🌍 **Biggest-Tallest-Fastest-of-the-world**
An automated, cinematic map exploration engine designed to showcase global superlatives. Built with MapLibre GL JS, this tool uses a "Tour-as-Code" approach to fly users across the globe, highlighting record-breaking locations with precision.

🚀 The Engine
This project isn't just a map; it's a Geospatial Presentation Engine. It solves common mapping hurdles like name ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between Georgia the country and Georgia the US state) and dynamic boundary loading.

Key Capabilities:
>> Cinematic Transitions: Smooth flight paths between points of interest with adjustable speeds.

>> Intelligent Disambiguation: Use Type (for regions) or Origin Country (for cities) to ensure the engine hits the exact record-holding location.

>> Dynamic UI: A searchable multi-select system to load high-detail regional data (Admin-1) only when needed.
